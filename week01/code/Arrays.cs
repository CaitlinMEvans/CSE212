        // PLAN FOR SOLVING "MULTIPLESOF":
        // 1. Create a new array of doubles with size 'length'
        // 2. Use a loop to iterate from 0 to length-1 (array indices)
        // 3. For each index i, calculate the multiple: number * (i + 1)
        //    - We use (i + 1) because we want 1st multiple, 2nd multiple, etc.
        //    - Example: for number=7, we want 7*1=7, 7*2=14, 7*3=21, etc.
        // 4. Store each calculated multiple in the array at index i
        // 5. Return the completed array

        // Step 1: Create array to store the multiples
        double[] result = new double[length];
        
        // Step 2-4: Calculate each multiple and store in array

        {
            result[i] = number * (i + 1);

        // be implemented by another person.

        // PLAN FOR SOLVING ROTATELISTRIGHT:
        // Approach: Use list slicing with GetRange, RemoveRange, and InsertRange methods
        // 1. Handle edge cases: if data is empty or amount is 0, do nothing
        // 2. Normalize the amount using modulo to handle cases where amount > data.Count
        //    - Example: rotating by 10 in a list of 9 items is same as rotating by 1
        // 3. Calculate the split point: where to cut the list for rotation
        //    - For right rotation by 'amount', we take the last 'amount' elements
        //    - Split point = data.Count - amount
        // 4. Use GetRange to extract the portion that moves to the front
        // 5. Use RemoveRange to remove that portion from the original location
        // 6. Use InsertRange to insert the extracted portion at the beginning
        //
        // Example with {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} rotating right by 3:
        // Original: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
        // Split point: 9-3 = 6, so split at index 6
        // Extract: {7,8,9} (from index 6 to end)
        // Remove: {7,8,9} from original, leaving {1,2,3,4,5,6}
        // Insert: {7,8,9} at beginning: {7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6} âœ“

        // Step 1: Handle edge cases
        if (data.Count == 0 || amount == 0)
            return;
        
        // Step 2: Normalize amount to handle cases where amount > data.Count
        amount = amount % data.Count;
        
        // If amount is 0 after modulo, no rotation needed
        if (amount == 0)
            return;
        
        // Step 3: Calculate split point for right rotation
        int splitPoint = data.Count - amount;
        
        // Step 4: Extract the portion that will move to the front
        List<int> rotatingPortion = data.GetRange(splitPoint, amount);
        
        // Step 5: Remove the rotating portion from its current location
        data.RemoveRange(splitPoint, amount);
